## Hey there!

I'm a developer who loves programmingâ€”the challenge, the puzzle, and especially the satisfaction of bringing all the pieces together into a result that everyone is happy with. As a Front-End Developer foremost, I have transformed various designs, ideas, and even raw concepts into functional and responsive user-friendly interfaces. On occasion, I will take on the Back-End role and responsibilities. I have experience and knowledge in setting up CRMs, working with APIs, setting up forms, site deployment, and site hosting. I may not know everything, but I will certainly figure it out!

I'm highly enthusiastic about technology and do my best to follow advancements. This drives me to continuously learn new computer-related skills, whether it's picking up another programming language or diving into yet another JavaScript framework or library.

In my free time, I like to explore other avenues of creativity. Recently, my technological hobbies have included game development, CAD modeling, and 3D modeling. Eventually, I'd like to improve my drawing abilities and, in tandem, enhance my design skills for the areas mentioned above.
